# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.js`.

The bug is triggered when the function `foo` is called with 'b' as 0, and 'a' as any other number resulting in an error.  The solution adds proper error handling to prevent this.
